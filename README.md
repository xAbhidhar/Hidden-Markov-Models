 ## What are hidden markov models?

The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a relatively simple way to model sequential data. 

A hidden Markov model implies that the Markov Model underlying the data is hidden or unknown to you. 

More specifically, you only know observational data and not information about the states. 
In other words, there’s a specific type of model that produces the data (a Markov Model) but you don’t know what processes are producing it. 

You basically use your knowledge of Markov Models to make an educated guess about the model’s structure.

What is Markov chain?
•	A Markov chain is "a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event"
## What is a Markov Model?
•	A Markov model is a stochastic model which is used to model randomly changing systems.
•	Named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov
•	It is assumed that future states depend only on the current state, not on the events that occurred before it
•	In the fields of predictive modelling and probabilistic forecasting, it is desirable for a given model to exhibit the Markov property.
## What is Markov Property?
•	Markov property refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process
